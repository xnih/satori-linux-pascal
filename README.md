# satori-linux-pascal
2009 Linux version ported from delphi to lazurus free pascal


This is really just out here for historic purposes, I've had lots of requests for the source.  This is the linux version, which I'm ok providing the source for.  Going to try to get this running on some ARM processors.


Note, if you install Lazurus and go to compile it and get an error about "error while linking", make sure you install libpcap-dev!

If you compile this with Lazurus, load project.lpr, go to Run > Build File and then you'll have a compiled satori file in the directory that you can run.
