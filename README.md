# satori-linux-pascal
2009 Linux version ported from delphi to lazurus pascal


This is really just out here for historic purposes, I've had lots of requests for the source.  This is the linux version, which I'm ok providing the source for.  Going to try to get this running on some ARM processors.


Note, if you install Lazurus and go to compile it and get an error about "error while linking", make sure you install libpcap-dev!
